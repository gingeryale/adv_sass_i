## sassy sass layout website project
A small layout website project using the box model to layout page elements.

### This simple imaginary website uses:
##### Sassy SASS with BEM
##### CSS3
##### Mixins, extends
##### Node-SASS
##### Box Model, floats and animations without any JS

It was created as part of a Udemy advanced SASS course I'm taking.
